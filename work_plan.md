**Implementation Planning - 1 hour**

* Basic implementation planning focussing specifically on the SLT functionality and how to get things to work using a bit slice approach.

**1-bit ALU implementation - 3 hours**

* Implement add/subtract - 1 hour

* Implement SLT - 1 hour

* Add logic functions - 1 hour

**1-bit test bench - 1 hour**

Test bench to test functionality of 1 bit ALU slice. Probably not exhaustive since there are a lot of possible combinations, but we will cover all the edge cases and a random sampling of middle cases.

**Chain together 1-bit ALUs into 32-bit, add control logic - 1 hour**

Chain our bit slices together into a 32 bit ALU, add control logic to handle 32 bit inputs more cleanly

**32-bit test bench - 2 hours**

Write a testbench to test functionally of our 32 bit ALU. Definitely not exhaustively so we will have to think about relevant edge cases.

**Lab report - 3 hours, 10 minutes**

* Implementation & results - 2 hours

* Timing analysis - 1 hour

* Work plan reflection - 10 minutes

**_Total - 11 hours, 10 minutes_**
