SLT

We choose 6 cases for SLT. There are 3 parameter related to results, sign of A, sign of B, and A < B. It could be categorized to 8(=2<sup>3</sup>) cases, but when A is negative and B is positive, A < B is always true and when A is positive and B is negative, A < B is always false. So there are only 6 categories.

For bitwise logic operations(XOR, AND, NAND, NOR, OR), we choose 2 cases and set each case to have 4 categories(in the truth table) in 32 bits.
