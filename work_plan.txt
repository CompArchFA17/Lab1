* Portions to consider:

Verilog:
- Construct the lookup table and circuit (1 hour)
* - Implement all functions (probably copy/paste from previous homeworks) (0.5 hours)
*         - expand for 32 bits
*         -optionally combine some methods
* - Implement LUT/mux/whatever we do input to choose the right function (0.5 hours)
* - Calculate timing calculations for the resulting circuit (0.1 hour)
* - Finished on 10/9

Test Bench:
- Decide which test cases to consider (0.25 hours)
* - Write the test bench (0.5 hours)
* - Run and debug test bench (0.1 hours)
- Finished on 10/9
   * Report:
- Write report (3 hours)
- Broken into two sessions (Tuesday evening, Wednesday evening)
- Finished on 10/11


Thursday (10/12) as leeway in case things overflow timing.
